###### Having developed a large number of applications and boilerplate code, of all the things I can't live without is a set of customisable layout components.

## Components
- ```<H1>...<H6>``` - text ranging from 1em to 2.5 em
- ```<Text/>``` - text with standardised font size and styles
- ```<Bold/>``` - same as text but bold
- ```<Container/>``` - container with standardised guttering
- ```<Row space noPad/>``` - Horizontal view with options to space apart and negate container gutter padding
- ```<Flex/>``` - view with flex, can override value with ``` value={x}```
- ```<Column/>``` columns within a row element, uses standard guttering

## Util
- ```em(value, baseValue)``` returns unit based on device width
